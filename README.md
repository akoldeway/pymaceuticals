# Pymaceuticals


## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze drug treatment data on mice and compare the results of the placebo and three specific drugs: Capomulin, Infubinol and Ketapril.  Treatment duration was 45 days.

## Analysis Performed
Data was analyzed over the course of 45 day and the following results calculated:
  * change in tumor volumes 
  * change in metastatic site counts
  * mouse survival rate
  * total volume change (%) 

## Summary of Observations
  * Capomulin was the most successful drug outperforming all three other drug and the placebo in all measurements and resulting in the only drug that reduced tumor volume over course of the treatment.
  * Infubinol had the lowest survival rate of all drugs and placebo.
  * Ketapril had the largest growth in overall tumor growth.
  
## Project Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries:
  * matplotlib.pylot
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * scipy.stats
  
The Data folder contains the .csv files used in analysis:
  * mouse_drug_data.csv
  * clinicaltrial_data.csv

## Project Environment
This is a jupyter notebook project. Open the pymaceutical.ipynb file in jupyter nobooks, restart Kernal and run all to view data results and charts illustrating analysis.
